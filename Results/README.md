## Results

This folder contains the A2C results subdivided for each minigame. At the moment it's a mess, since a lot of old backups and raw data are present. 
The important part is that all runs have a code of 4 capital letters to recognize them and sometimes also the weights of the model are saved, 
although I never actually re-used them for the A2C agent. It's probably better to refer to the notebooks to understand what they contain and how to use this data.

Results for IMPALA are under a different folder (../logs/ from here)
